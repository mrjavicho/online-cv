    "aboutMe": "I began my career as a professional software developer 9 years ago. Throughout this time, I have worked on a wide range of projects spanning various industries and technologies. My experience includes developing banking applications, creating data reports for drilling operations, and designing logistic delivery tools. I've worked with diverse technologies, including WindowsPhone, Android, iOS, WPF, ADO.net, .netCore, and, notably, Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms. I pride myself on being a problem solver, steadfast in the belief that "everything is possible." In the early years of my career, I often met challenges with sheer effort and long hours. As my experience has grown, my approach has shifted to dissecting problems, proposing multiple solutions, testing different strategies, and even designing custom tools to achieve my objectives. My passion for software development is unwavering, and I am always eager to learn new skills. Central to my philosophy is the principle of "learning by doing", and I am committed to continuous growth and evolution in my profession."
