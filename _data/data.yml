career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: |
      I began my career as a professional software developer 9 years ago. 
      Throughout this time, I have worked on a wide range of projects spanning various industries and technologies. 
      
      My experience includes developing banking applications, creating data reports for drilling operations, or designing logistic delivery tools. 
      I've worked with diverse technologies, including WindowsPhone, Android, iOS, WPF, ADO.net, .NET Core, and, notably, Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms. 

      I pride myself on being a problem solver, steadfast in the belief that "everything is possible." 
      In the early years of my career, I often met challenges with sheer effort and long hours. As my experience has grown, my approach has shifted to dissecting problems, proposing multiple solutions, testing different strategies, and even designing custom tools to achieve my objectives. 
      
      I am passionate about software development, and I am always eager to learn new skills. 
      Central to my philosophy is the principle of "learning by doing", and I am committed to continuous growth and evolution in my profession.      
current-position:
    title: Current activities
    summary: |
      As the tech leader of a group of four developers, I am responsible for addressing critical issues, proposing ideas, and assisting the team. 
      
      My role involves maintaining a steady stream of urgent and important topics to address, allowing us to focus on stability, simplicity, and testability.
      I create diagrams for new features and analyze the impact of upcoming change requests, sometimes suggesting new internal tools or libraries. 
      
      Code-wise, I'm usually in charge of core functionality, creating PoCs, adding new tests, and developing scripts, libraries and tools. 
      
      Finally, I periodically stablish milestones for the mobile area, covering all projects, internal libraries, and tools.

education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: VET Web Applications Development
        university: I.E.S San Juan de la Cruz, Madrid
        time: 2012-2014
        details: |
          After some bad experiences in college, I chose to enroll in a vocational training program to quickly launch my career. 
          I was highly motivated to learn and work in a field that I was passionate about. 
          Throughout the program, I acquired fundamental skills in web development technologies, including PHP, HTML, JS, CSS, and MySQL.         

      - degree: Master's in Web Application Development using C#
        university: Instituto Tajamar, Madrid
        time: 2013 - 2014
        details: |
          In 2014, I devoted additional study time to complete a master's course in web application development using C#. 
          During the course, I was introduced to technologies such as ASP.NET MVC, Azure, jQuery, and Blazor, as well as techniques for consuming REST and SOAP web services. At the time, the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) was gaining traction, so we also covered the basics of XAML. 
          Additionally, I created my first applicaction using Xamarin.

    info:
      - role: Mobile Team Lead
        time: 2020 - Present
        company: Zetes Multicom, Madrid
        details: |          
          Since joining Zetes, I've been involved in large-scale, thriving projects. 
          The applications we develop for various logistics areas have achieved great success and, as a result, require constant evolution.         
          To make our products more stable, we have invested significant effort in enhancing documentation, analysis, component reusability, and more. 

          Working with manufacturers such as Honeywell, Zebra, and Datalogic is a key part of our applications, as they provide barcode scanning and printing functionalities. 
          During my time here, we have addressed a number of challenges, including targeting new Android versions, UI customization, adding barcode recognition for BYOD clients, and successfully addressing our clients' needs with versatile, one-size-fits-all solutions.


      - role: Mobile Tech Lead
        time: 2020 - 2020
        company: Atmira Consulting, Barcelona
        details: |
          I was hired to lead the mobile team that would work on a new mobile app for one of the biggest banks in Andorra.
          During a six month period, me and and other three developers managed to overcome very complicated legacy code, create an iOS version almost from scratch,
          introduce CI/CD practices, integrate third party libraries for digital signing and onboarding, and finally getting the first versions ready for testing on AppStore and PlayStore.
            
      - role: Senior mobile developer / Tech Lead
        time: 2017 - 2020
        company: Bravent, Madrid
        details: |
          During my later years at Bravent, I was promoted to Senior Developer and subsequently to Tech Lead. 
          As with everything at Bravent, these new roles demanded a lot of hard work and learning on my part. 
          I began taking on the responsibility for entire projects, which involved dealing with clients, estimates, deadlines, and a wide range of challenges. 
          
          I gained valuable experience in interpersonal skills, problem-solving with a positive attitude, and leading by example. 
          I initiated regular code review sessions and small group discussions to identify issues in our ongoing projects. 
          As a result, we were able to establish a set of best practices, align our ideas, and support each other more effectively.
